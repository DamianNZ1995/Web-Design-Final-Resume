                  <h1>PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY</h1>
                  <p>My love for Golf has led me to over 5 years of experience as the Head of Junior Coaching at a top tier academy. I am a collaborative, 
                    passionate, and motivating leader who has been commended for ingenuity. I have made significant contributions to the academy 
                    and served in all aspects of operations including supervising, scheduling, and directing junior golf programs, as well as coaching 
                    and mentoring children aged 4 to 18 years. I possess a solid work ethic, meticulous attention to detail, with a commitment to 
                    unbeatable customer service which has allowed members and peers to view me as a club pro who is diligent, reliable, and 
                    knowledgeable about the game. My expertise lies in engaging with members and peers as an articulate communicator and quickly 
                    establishing rapport. My ability to impart knowledge with ease, combined with my conscientious and flexible personality, allows me 
                    to build a strong repertoire.
                    </p>
                    <p>My objective is to obtain a position in a company where there are opportunities to grow and enhance operations</p>
